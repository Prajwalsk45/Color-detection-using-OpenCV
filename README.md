Yellow Object Detection using OpenCV

This project uses OpenCV, Pillow (PIL), and NumPy to detect yellow-colored objects in real-time from a webcam feed. It applies color thresholding in the HSV color space to create a mask and draws a bounding box around the detected yellow object.

# Features

- Real-time yellow object detection
- HSV color space conversion
- Dynamic bounding box using Pillow
- Webcam video feed with OpenCV
